Questions:
----------
Q)Does server needs to be informed while transferring job?
A) IMO, yes. Because server is responsible for fault-tolerance.



Design:
1) DataTransfer Cycle
    File is transferred separately (to handle cases where data is not fit into main memory)

a compute node daemon which will take care of all the load 
balancing and communications with the server. . You can then spawn worker threads to 
do the actual sorting part assigned to the compute node.

Draw design diagram

2) Node status checker maintains a map<NodeId, last visited time>
   if last visited time is more than 30 secs... server assumes node is dead.

heart.beat.interval for every 30 secs...


Configuration:
--------------




Assumptions:
-----------
Data format 
Only one job at a time

 

Simple test cases:
-----------------
Sorting one value
sorting 10 values
duplicate values

Print node stats
Print task stats




Terminalogy:
Job: client submits the job
Task: A Job is splitted into tasks.
