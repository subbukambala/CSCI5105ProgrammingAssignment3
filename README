Description: The following code was done as an assignment for CSCI5105 at the
University of Minnesota. This system was built to evaluate the performance of
a MapReduce framework that was only capable of sorting. The evaluation is 
focused on sorting time based on a fail probability and load probability.

FILES:
------
** DesignAndPerformanceDocument.nb = The design and performance report as a 
Mathematic notebook.
** DesignAndPerformanceDocument.pdf = The design and performance report as a 
pdf.
** README = This file.
** jars/ = A directory with jars that this project depends on.
** scripts/ = A directory with scripts for running and testing.
**** scripts/RunServer.sh = A script to run the server.
**** scripts/RunComputeNode.sh = A script to run a compute node.
**** scripts/RunClient.sh = A script to run the client.
**** scripts/RunTest.sh = Runs a single test. Tests can be parameterized by
 number of nodes, number of integers, output prefix, and individual compute 
node parameters. Output for /ALL/ processes is output in results.
**** scripts/TestBattery.sh = Uses RunTest.sh to generate lots of performance
results.
**** scripts/support.sh = Used by all the other scripts.
**** scripts/shflags = Used to handle bash script command line arguments 
gracefully.
** src/ = The directory containing all the source to this program.
** results/ = The directory where output will be placed when TestBattery.sh 
is run.
** results/results.csv = The file analyzed by the Mathematica notebook.
** cfg/ = Contains a default configuration file as required by the assignment
specification.
**** cfg/default.config = The deafult configuration as required by the 
assignment specification. Though I would use the command line options because
they are easier.

TO BUILD:
---------
cd src/
make clean
make


RUNNING (SHOOT THE MOON):
------------------------

I will walk through a very simple execution of this system. All host names
will need to be changed accordingly. This system instantiation will be composed
of 3 ComputeNodes, 1 Server and 1 Client. Each section has output where
appropriate in line. Not all output is shown due to amount. If you would like 
to look over output, please use the RunTest.sh which will store output in 
appropriate files. A line with '...' following output indicates
there was more that was truncated.

The scenario run here will involve three sort tasks.
After each sort task, server and node statistics will be output.
The data files shown here can be found in "results/demo1.dat","demo2.dat",
and "demo3.dat".
